<h2>Alarm<h2>
  <h3>The user can set alarms in 24 hour format using a clock picker.  Set alarms are saved locally on the user's device such that set alarms are retained when the app is closed & re-opened.  On the time of a particular set & active alarm a sound is played.  An alarm can be set as active/inactive using its adjacent toggle switch & can also be deleted using the modal which shows at the bottom when one long presses the particular alarm.<h3>
